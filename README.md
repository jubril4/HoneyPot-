## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while doing the assignment.
I encountered challenges setting up the virtual machine for the Gmail cloud, I kept encountering syntax errors so it was frustruating at first, but once I kept reading over the instructions a few times, the compiler became a little bit easier as time went on.
